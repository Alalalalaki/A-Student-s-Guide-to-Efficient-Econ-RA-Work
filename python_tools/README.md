- The python files placed in this folder are some simple python tools either homemade or stolen from someone else.
  - Note that you can simply use them as some snippets. But if you want import them like the one you installed through conda or pip, you need add the dir where you place your modules to `sys.path`. (one way to do this is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37008663))
  - You can always try to write your own helpfyl modules.
