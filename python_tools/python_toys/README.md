## Note

- These code here is neither smart nor elegant. Anyone can write such code after learning python for about one month. The only thing I want to illustrate here is that you can always invent your own helpfuyl tools whatever your level is.
- Note that in order to import the python modules you developed globally, you need add the dir where you place your modules to `sys.path`. (one way to do this is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37008663))
