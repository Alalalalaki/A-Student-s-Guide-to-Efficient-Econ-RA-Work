## Jupyter Lab Tools and Tips

---

> "Code is read much more often than it is written."

- You can install [this app](https://github.com/telamonian/jupyter-app) to launch Jupyter Lab.
- You can use [IPython configuration](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/intro.html) to set default settings that you would use every time. ([an example](settings/ipython_config.py))
- Learn [shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). And note that you can customize the shortcuts for many operations shown in the command tab.
  - For example, setting a shortcut for `clear output` would be useful when using git to version-control ipynb files.
- Learn [magic commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).
  - For example, `%pdb` and `%debug` is helpful for debugging.
- This [extension](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_sublime) gives you additional sublime-like keybinding in cells, which can be extremely helpful in many situations.
  - For example, try command+d or command+g.
- This [extension](https://github.com/ryantam626/jupyterlab_code_formatter) gives you code auto-formatter in Jupyter Lab. Note that you can set a customized shortcut for this function.
- ~~This [extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-toc) gives you table of contents.~~
- Slide mode is available in Jupyter Lab. See the example [here](slide/test.ipynb).
- [R](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) and [Stata](https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel) kernel is available in Jupyter.
- You can use nteract or vscode to open a `.ipynb` file directly.
- See this repo - [Ten simple rules for writing and sharing computational analyses in Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter-guide/ten-rules-jupyter) - for writing reproducible notebooks.
