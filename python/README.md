## Python Tools and Tips

---

- Use both jupyter notebook and editor. They work best in different situations. In particular, I find that while the former is helpful to scratch or test any rondom code, the latter is useful to write down any formal and reproducible code. The most commonly recommended editor is vscode.
- Use conda environment. The advance operation is to use virtual environment for different projects.
- Useful python packages (except numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.):
  - Econ & Econometrics
    - linearmodels
    - [interpolation](https://github.com/EconForge/interpolation.py)
    - quantecon
    - pyblp / torchblp
    - numecon
    - [Estimagic](https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [respy, grmpy](https://ose-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenSourceEconomics.html#model-packages)
    - [HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK)
  - Plotting
    - altair
    - matplotlib-label-lines
    - folium
    - geopandas
  - Data
    - japandas
    - missingno
    - pandas-datareader
  - Database
    - [sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
    - [Ibis](https://docs.ibis-project.org/)
  - Web scrapping
    - requests or requests-html
    - selenium
  - Others
    - panel
- The python files placed in the [util](/util) folder are some simple snippets that are either homemade or stolen from the internet. These are the simplest examples of building wheels that can make life easy.
  - You can simply apply these snippets into your code.
  - Alternatively you can import them just like the one you installed through conda or pip. In order to do this, you need add the dir where you place your modules to `sys.path`. (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37008663) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12257807) if you don't know how to do it).
  - Moreover you can make some module to be executed automatically whenever you launch the python kernel in a Jupyter notebook.
  - Note tha you can always try to write your own helpful wheels.
